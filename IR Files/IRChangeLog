Added ROM demo that runs off of mouse demo and given VGA border values to assert IR commands depending on mouse location.
Added option to show IR commands on 7-seg display and slide switch states on the LEDS.
Added high address to slide switch verilog file (0xE1) so the highest 4 switches can control the car select.
Changed top level and wrapper to accomodate 16 bit slide switch input.
Mouse Y address should be changed as VGA demo and IR both control like flight sim (ie. bottom is forward, top is backward).
Current test ROM file is already large, would recommend reducing 7-seg display options for final demo. IR command logic could possibly be optimised?
