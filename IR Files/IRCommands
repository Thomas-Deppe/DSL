IR commands are 8-bit words, the 4 ms-bits choose which car is to be controlled and the 4 lsbs control the direction.
The cars are selected with each of the following commands:

Red Car     - 1000
Green Car   - 0100
Yellow Car  - 0010
Blue Car    - 0001

The directions are selected with the following commands, they can be combined for more complex directions:

Neutral     - 0000
Right       - 0001
Left        - 0010
Backwards   - 0100
Forwards    - 1000

So an example command for a red car going backwards would be 10000100 or 0x84
A yellow car going forward left would be 00101010 or 0x2A
